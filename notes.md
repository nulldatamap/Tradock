So the AI's decision making is going to be based on:
* Threshold, how low to buy, how high to sell?
* Stability, how likely are we to buy and sell in unstable markets?
* Longevity, are we going for short-term or long-term investments?
* Risk, how much is on the line for us?
* Tiredness, how many times have we seen good opportunities go buy?
* Group behaviour, how likely are we to mimic the actions of others?
* Bias, do we have a bias towards a certain market?
* Context?, outside data that might help predict the market
