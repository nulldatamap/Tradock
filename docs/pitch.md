# The Pitch
## Base idea
Tradock is a game about trading in a lively economy. You'll start out with some initial funds and try to compete and earn more funds over time. The things you'll be trading are different goods and resources like gold, clothes, oil, food, art, etc..

## Technical goals
* A fully AI driven economy, each transaction is done by another agent based on it's trading "personality".
* A console interface to play the game through.

## Secondary goals
* Events and outside context that drives the economy indirectly.
* A 2D UI to play the game through as an alternative the console interface ( mock-up: ![mock-up](https://github.com/thebreadcat/Tradock/blob/master/mock-up.png "Tradock graphics style mock-up")
 ).
